Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the churn rate of a company by examining customer data. The project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the company's customer retention patterns.

Objectives:

Clean the raw dataset for analysis.

Perform univariate and bivariate analysis.

Group the data into relevant columns for better insights.

Analyze the key factors contributing to customer churn.

Draw conclusions based on the analysis.


Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
Handled missing or inconsistent values in the dataset.
Removed irrelevant columns that don't contribute to the analysis.
2. Data Grouping
Grouped customers based on their tenure and payment methods.
3. Univariate Analysis
Analyzed individual columns (e.g., tenure, payment methods) to understand distributions.
4. Bivariate Analysis
Performed analysis between different pairs of columns to understand relationships (e.g., payment method vs. churn rate, tenure vs. churn).
5. Conclusion
Summarized findings from the analysis, highlighting the key factors influencing customer churn.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook

Conclusion

Based on the analysis, several factors such as payment methods, tenure, and internet service usage were found to significantly impact the churn rate. These insights can help the company improve its customer retention strategies.

**Data Analysis and Regression with Tips Dataset**

This project demonstrates a data analysis and regression workflow on a dataset containing information on restaurant tips. The analysis involves data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and setting up a regression model to predict outcomes based on the dataset features.

**Project Structure**

Jupyter Notebook:
The main file, DAI_2_23112043.ipynb, contains the code and documentation for the data analysis and regression tasks.
Dataset: The notebook loads a dataset named tips (data for regression problem) (1).csv, which should be placed in the appropriate directory if you’re running the notebook locally.

Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn


**Steps Covered in the Notebook**

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using pandas.
Data Exploration: Basic information about the dataset, including the first few rows and summary statistics, is displayed.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The notebook includes code for data cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and correlation analyses are conducted to understand relationships in the data.
Model Training: A regression model is trained on the data to predict the target variable.
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².

Usage
To run the notebook:

Clone the repository.
Ensure the dataset is in the specified path within the notebook.
Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and model results.
Results
The final section of the notebook provides insights from the regression model and visualizations to interpret the model's predictions.
