Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the churn rate of a company by examining customer data. The project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the company's customer retention patterns.

Objectives:

Clean the raw dataset for analysis.

Perform univariate and bivariate analysis.

Group the data into relevant columns for better insights.

Analyze the key factors contributing to customer churn.

Draw conclusions based on the analysis.


Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
Handled missing or inconsistent values in the dataset.
Removed irrelevant columns that don't contribute to the analysis.
2. Data Grouping
Grouped customers based on their tenure and payment methods.
3. Univariate Analysis
Analyzed individual columns (e.g., tenure, payment methods) to understand distributions.
4. Bivariate Analysis
Performed analysis between different pairs of columns to understand relationships (e.g., payment method vs. churn rate, tenure vs. churn).
5. Conclusion
Summarized findings from the analysis, highlighting the key factors influencing customer churn.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook

Conclusion

Based on the analysis, several factors such as payment methods, tenure, and internet service usage were found to significantly impact the churn rate. These insights can help the company improve its customer retention strategies.
